          Lift every voice and sing,<br>
          Till earth and heaven ring,<br>
          Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;<br>
          Let our rejoicing rise<br>
          High as the list'ning skies,<br>
          Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.<br>
          Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,<br>
          Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;<br>
          Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,<br>
          Let us march on till victory is won.<br>
        </p>

        <p class="poem__stanza">
          Stony the road we trod,<br>
          Bitter the chast'ning rod,<br>
          Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;<br>
          Yet with a steady beat,<br>
          Have not our weary feet<br>
          Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?<br>
          We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.<br>
          We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,<br>
          Out from the gloomy past,<br>
          Till now we stand at last<br>
          Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.<br>
        </p>

        <p class="poem__stanza">
          God of our weary years,<br>
          God of our silent tears,<br>
          Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;<br>
          Thou who hast by Thy might,<br>
          Led us into the light,<br>
          Keep us forever in the path, we pray.<br>
          Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,<br>
          Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;<br>
          Shadowed beneath Thy hand,<br>
          May we forever stand,<br>
          True to our God,<br>
          True to our native land. <br>
